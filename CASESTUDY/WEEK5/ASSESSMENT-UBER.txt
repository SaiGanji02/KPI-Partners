1.	Use SQL* Loader to load the all the files to an Oracle Database table

OPTIONS ( SKIP=1)
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'C:\Users\SaikumarGanji\Downloads\Fact_trip.csv'
TRUNCATE INTO TABLE FACT_TRIP
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ","
(trip_uuid,datestr,product_type_name,city_id,driver_uuid,is_completed,eta,ata,ufp_fare,fare_final)


D:\PLSQL>sqlldr userid=saikdb/root control='D:\PLSQL\new.ctl'

OPTIONS (SKIP=1)
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'C:\Users\SaikumarGanji\Downloads\Dim_city.csv'
TRUNCATE INTO TABLE dim_city
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ","
(city_id,city_name,country)

2.	Create the table structure with appropriate data types before loading with SQL Loader

create table fact_trip(TRIP_UUID	VARCHAR2(20),
DATESTR	DATE,
PRODUCT_TYPE_NAME	VARCHAR2(20),
CITY_ID	NUMBER,
DRIVER_UUID	VARCHAR2(200),
IS_COMPLETED	VARCHAR2(10),
ETA	NUMBER,
ATA	NUMBER,
UFP_FARE	NUMBER,
FARE_FINAL	NUMBER);
       
create table dim_city(city_id number,city_name varchar(50),
country varchar(10));



3.	Answer the following questions
a.	How many city_ids does uberPOOL operate in?
b.	Which city_id has the highest error in ETA (where error in ETA = {(eta - ata)/ata}) for the given time period?
c.	Which is the product type with highest total revenue in SanFrancisco?
d.	Which are the products in each city where total revenue(fare_final) > $1000?
e.	Get to 2nd highest country by Uber Revenue (fare_fin``al) for 2nd week of June 2018 across product
f.	Get WOW growth % for US region for June Month. WOW- Week over week .
g.	Growth % = ((Current week fare final - previous week fare final) / previous week fare final) * 100



ANSWERS:

a.select  COUNT(DISTINCT(CITY_ID)) FROM FACT_TRIP WHERE PRODUCT_TYPE_NAME='uberPOOL';

------

b.select * from(select city_id,(eta-ata)/ata as ETA from fact_trip
order by ETA desc) where rownum=1;

---------

c.select product_type_name from fact_trip where fare_final = (select max(fare_final) from 
(select fare_final from fact_trip where city_id=(select city_id from dim_city where city_name = 'SanFrancisco')));

--------------

d.select city_id from fact_trip where fare_final>1000;

-------------
e.select * from(select d.country, f.fare_final, rownum as rank from dim_city d join fact_trip f on d.city_id=f.city_id 
where to_char(datestr, 'W')=2 order by 2) where mod(rank, 2)=0;

-------------------

f.select(((select sum(fare_final) from fact_trip where to_char(datestr, 'W')=1)- (select sum(fare_final)
from fact_trip where to_char(datestr, 'W')=2))/ (select sum(fare_final) from fact_trip 
where to_char(datestr, 'W')=1)) * 100 as "Growth%" from fact_trip group by datestr;

--------------

g.select (((select sum(fare_final) from fact_trip where to_char(datestr, 'W')='1') - (select sum(fare_final)
 from fact_trip where to_char(datestr, 'W')='2')) / (select sum(fare_final) from fact_trip 
where to_char(datestr, 'W')='1')) * 100 as "Growth%" from dual;
